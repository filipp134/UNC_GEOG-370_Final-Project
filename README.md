# UNC_GEOG-370_Final-Project
In Spring 2023 Semester, I took GEOG 370 "Introduction to Geographic Information" course taught by Phd student Devon Maloney at UNC. As part of such course, we were assigned to do a group research project. In the group consisting of me and fellow students Andrew Mackin, Sophie Brager and Alexandra Ayala, we studied the housing proplems associated with flooding in North Carolina. The study's research question was 'what, if any, is the spatial relationship between flooding and socioeconomic inequality in NC?', and our hypthesis was that flooding in NC disproportionately affects low-income communities with less access to house insurance. In our study we used several datasets published by various departments of NC and federal government for data and QGIS software for analysis. As part of analysis, we did EDA, visualization, and simple correlation analysis in order to prove or reject our hypothesis. Overall, we found that there is a correlation between flood risk and socioeconomic inequality in NC. As a part of final project we did the ArcGIS Storymap and a brief 5-page final report.
